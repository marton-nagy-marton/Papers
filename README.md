# This repository contains a selection of my papers written so far
Papers included are: bachelor's thesis, course papers written during my studies at Széchenyi István College for Advanced Studies (the paper for the fourth semester is not included, as it contains sensitive company information) reports written for my courses at CEU, Scientific Students' Association (TDK) papers (both university and national level), and a published paper in the Hungarian Political Science Review (Politikatudományi Szemle). If available, the repository also contains paper defense presentations and source data.
